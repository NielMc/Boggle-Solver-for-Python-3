### Boggle Solver

- Based on the word game Boggle where the aim is to find words in sequences of adjacent letters in a grid. 
- The user can specify a grid size which is randomly filled with letters and a list of words generated. 
- Uses recursion to search avoiding the exponetially search growth with larger grids. 
- Demonstrates how both algorithms and data structures can impact on performance. 
- Topics covered are algorithm creation, data structures, testing and recursion. 


### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- This is an edit to exiting code to make it work with Python 3. 
- Compare with the python2 version of this code in another of my repositories. 

### Getting Started/Requirements/Prerequisites/Dependencies
Uses:
- Python 3.6
- Unitest library


### More Specific Topics (+ sample sub-categories)
- Tests exist for most functions in the boggle.py code. 


### Contributing
- Code written by richardadalton for Code-Institute-Org

### TODO
- Currently random letters rather than chosen from dice as per actual game. 
- Does not support the Qu letter of the realworld game. 
- Allows words of less than 3 letters.
